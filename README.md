# EddieBalance
Eddie the Balance Bot is a self blanacing robot based on the Intel Edison and Sparkfun Blocks.

This project now reflects my EddiePlus design which incorporates encoders and some new body stylings. The new 3D models and details including a builder's guide are available on thingiverse: www.thingiverse.com/thing:694969

The build details for the original Eddie are on thingiverse: www.thingiverse.com/thing:655423


If you need help building your Eddie please contact me through thingiverse and I'll get an email back to you.
