Eddie the Balance Bot

Please bear with me while I figure out github in my spare time.
There are a lot of details to be added here in the near future.

*I've tried to clean things up a bit. Better instructions will be provided soon but for now...

EddieBalance requires libmraa to be installed. I don't have the exact steps documented for Yocto but I did derive a solution from https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/installing-libmraa-on-ubilinux-for-edison

If you'd like to automatically run the Eddie software when your Edison turns on see the extras directory.
